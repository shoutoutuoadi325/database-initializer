The current version implements the following functions besides the requirements listed in the document on the Elearning.
1. User can specify the path of the csv file, which means that user have no need to copy files to "src\main\resources" before running the program. <br>
2.The program will automatically use the name of the csv file as the name of the table in the database. <br>
3. The program will automatically insert NULL when the csv file does not give a value for an attribute in a tuple. 

If you want a version which exactly realizes all the functions required but without any additional functions listed above, recover git version "e51208dc7aabe433524c532bfd46459ab4dded06".
